Hello privacy conscious *fellow* human (unless you are a bot, in which case, hello privacy conscious bot *from* a human). There is emphasis on "fellow" because I am {{your_admin_handle}}, your humble {{your_instance_name}} admin and I am very much human. I am not a big corporation, I am not a bot, I am a living, breathing, human and you being here means we share common human interests.

I see we share a common interest in privacy, and that is very good! I want you to make an informed decision on how you manage your privacy, because that a distinction here over other platforms: your privacy is your responsibility and I want you to be hyper aware of this. I want you to be informed so that you engage with this platform in a way that ensures you are managing your privacy responsibly. Because it is YOUR responsibility no matter where you go.

You are agreeing to be a part of a very exciting and emerging technology. However if you are unfamiliar, it is imperitive that you educate yourself on open federated models and what that means for your privacy. The privacy goal here may be different than what you are accustomed to. 

A monolith platform (what you might be used to: Meta;reddit;TikTok) provides a measure of control over how public your engagement is while leaving you open to being tracked and profiled; open federated protects you from being tracked with a cost of having less control over how public your engagement is (and will potentially remain). **This distinction is very important to fully understand before engaging on this platform.**

It is also important to recognize that this is early, and experimental software. It will not be guarenteed to be free from flaws. 

It is my responsibility to make my best efforts to ensure that sensitive information that could identify or otherwise track you does not leave this local instance. This includes things such as your email and IP address. This information is not federated and my controls on maintaining this component of privacy is what the policy outlines. However all *your* engagement (profile;comments;direct messages;votes;subscriptions;follows) is often completely public and you must act according to your comfort level in managing what you would prefer to remain private.
